Virtual SVG-based keyboard in Java. Easily extensible using any SVG-editor

ToDo:
- Add comments
- Write and generate Javadoc
- Create some way to make layer-handling abstract (so layer types can be defined in SVG), currently supported layers are capslock, alt and shift, because this is enough for my needs. But users should be able to use any number
